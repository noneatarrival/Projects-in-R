## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = T}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Where is the source of the formatting issue?

Try a list: 

* One
  - Two
* Two
  - Three

So, something is really wrong:

- List
- Should
- Be
- Very
- Very Easy

Here is another attempt:  

* One
* Two
* Three
No messing about

This seems like f@cking nonsense to me:
  
1. First
    + Sub one
1. Second
    + Sub two
    + Sub three
1. Third
    + Sub four

Done    

Try a list with \@ signs  

@ First
@ Second
@ Third
   
Then try continuing that list

@ One
@ Two
@ Three
    
Done

<!--Sh!t busted, so draw a line -->
***

List above should just work, w/out worrying about spaces:  

1. Wake up
    + Get out of bed
    + Warm up food
1. Open kitchen door
    + Get plate out of cupboard
1. Make coffee
  i. Warm up water
  i. Grind beans
3. Make breakfast


# Highest level
- First  [need two spaces at eol]
- Second
- See what happened, above [not followed by two spaces at eol -- removing trailing spaces]  

## Next level
Will it behave differently? The second header wasn't showing up.  

- Next list misbehaving  
- No spaces  
- What happens?  [added trailing spaces]  

~~ Strikethrough ~~
~~strikethrough~~

### Next level
Again, third level, like the second level wasn't showing up.  

- Next list with mixed spacing  
- So this line has  
- This line and the first, do not  


# New section
No new line space -- turns out fine.  

- But my list?  
- No spaces?  
- None at all?  

# Testing Lists {#anchor}

With a line space, and now trying --strikethrough-- or ~~strikethrough~~
Just a return after the last line above (so this line is on the same line)  
Two spaces, after the line above (so this is a new paragraph)  
Would that then explain lists?  
* Any  
* Old  
* Way  

Can I create a list after this?  
* Item 1  
  + Sub-item 1
  + Sub-item 2  

What happens to this paragraph?  

This seems nonsensical.  
<!--Why does nothing work???-->
\textbf{text ignored in HTML}
<em><a href="http://www.mylink.com/">link here</a></em>

As long as you put a double space after each one?
Or is it better to do it like this:  
* No spaces
* After each
* Item
* Until you reach the last one  
This might look, as I expect? Nope. No list created.   

> Absolutely maddening

# Trying numbered lists
This first list:  
1. First item  
1. Second item  
1. Third item  

The second list, w/ indents:  
1. First item  
  * Second item  
  * Third item  
1. Second major item  
  * Second sub item
1. Third major item  

Done

So, you need to always put double spaces to create new lines.  
Or else, you end up with
Run on sentences, even though
In Studio I am pressing carriage
Return after with/ though/ and carriage  

Total mess, then when it comes to lists.  
* Trying one here  
    Another here  
    And another here  
    And more here  
How did we do?

@ This seems confusing  
But it's hard to say, if I'm doing it  
@ Or the code is
