## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = T}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Highest level
- First  [need two spaces at eol]
- Second
- See what happened, above [not followed by two spaces at eol -- removing trailing spaces]  

## Next level
Will it behave differently? The second header wasn't showing up.  

- Next list misbehaving  
- No spaces  
- What happens?  [added trailing spaces]  

~~ Strikethrough ~~
~~strikethrough~~

### Next level
Again, third level, like the second level wasn't showing up.  

- Next list with mixed spacing  
- So this line has  
- This line and the first, do not  


# New section
No new line space -- turns out fine.  

- But my list?  
- No spaces?  
- None at all?  

# Testing Lists {#anchor}

With a line space, and now trying --strikethrough-- or ~~strikethrough~~
Just a return after the last line above (so this line is on the same line)  
Two spaces, after the line above (so this is a new paragraph)  
Would that then explain lists?  
* Any  
* Old  
* Way  

Can I create a list after this?  
* Item 1  
  + Sub-item 1
  + Sub-item 2  

What happens to this paragraph?  

This seems nonsensical.  
<!--Why does nothing work???-->
\textbf{text ignored in HTML}
<em>HTML ignored in pdfs</em>

As long as you put a double space after each one?
Or is it better to do it like this:  
* No spaces
* After each
* Item
* Until you reach the last one  
This might look, as I expect? Nope. No list created.  

So, you need to always put double spaces to create new lines.  
Or else, you end up with
Run on sentences, even though
In Studio I am pressing carriage
Return after with/ though/ and carriage  

Total mess, then when it comes to lists.  
* Trying one here  
    Another here  
    And another here  
    And more here  
How did we do?

@ This seems confusing  
But it's hard to say, if I'm doing it  
@ Or the code is
